# Intricate's Julia scripts

Some miscellaneous scripts that I feel people should have access to. Not all of them are pretty and optimized but they get the task done. There should be docstrings on all the top level methods.

Often these depend on `NBT`, `Litematica`, and `MinecraftDataStructures`, which can be found on my github but aren't in the main registry yet. They might get added if they're ever polished enough.

- bruteforce_chamber.jl: Code for finding and displaying optimal blast chamber layouts for both a fixed explosion power and a random one (aka minecarts).
- pearl_bounces.jl: Code for finding optimal pearl bounces for tnt cannons.
